# breakout
A simple implementation of breakout using my jedesjardins/gfx library.

# Building

Pre-requisites include CMake, GLFW, and Vulkan, for building, window creation, and graphics respectively. As long as CMake can find GLFW and Vulkan, you should be golden.

Build with:

```
$ cmake <path_to_breakout_CMakeLists.txt>
$ make
```

And run with:
```
$ ./breakout
```
